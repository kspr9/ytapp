# ytapp

In this repo you'll find me playing around with PyTube package

ytdl.py is just a cli script. run the script and it will give you options

ytapp.py is pretty much the same thing except added some coloring with colorama and added download progress info.

testingytdl.py test if ytdl works as package when imported

and lastly GUI.py uses PySimpleGUI package to create a GUI app. Install requirements and run python3 GUI.py

or you can import gui_app from GUI if that is what you want for some reason :)

Happy playing!
